## Git Worktrees for Claude Code

This repository uses nested git worktrees to enable parallel development with Claude Code. All worktrees are located under `worktrees/` directory for Claude Code accessibility.

### Worktree Structure
```

### Working with Worktrees

**Quick Start:** See `.claude/howto/setup-worktree.md` for complete worktree setup instructions.

**Key Resources:**
- `.claude/howto/setup-worktree.md` - Complete setup guide (uv, venv, mamba)
- `.claude/howto/setup-environment.md` - Environment options comparison
- `.claude/reference/uv-adoption.md` - UV details and Python 3.13 notes
- `.claude/reference/core-requirements.txt` - Package list

#### Legacy Mamba Setup

For mamba-based setup, see `.claude/reference/environment-types.md`.

### Best Practices
- Always create worktrees under `worktrees/` directory
- Use descriptive names matching the feature
- **Use uv for speed** - setup takes seconds, not minutes
- **Currently: activate environment** due to Python 3.13 compatibility
- See cleanup commands in `.claude/howto/setup-worktree.md`
- **IMPORTANT**: Also remove `.claude/plans/*/feature-{branch-name}.md` when cleaning up merged worktrees
- Use correct pip package names: `matplotlib` (not matplotlib-base), `tables` (not pytables)
- Pull master in each worktree to access latest `.claude/plans/`

### Build System and Testing

**CRITICAL**: Each worktree MUST use a separate Python environment.

For complete build and testing information, see:
- `.claude/reference/build-isolation.md` - Why isolation is required
- `.claude/howto/setup-worktree.md` - Setup instructions
- `.claude/howto/setup-environment.md` - Environment options

## CFD-Based Wind Parameterization Integration

### Overview
SUEWS now includes a CFD-based wind parameterization scheme (DiagMethod=3) that enables accurate city-scale wind prediction using morphological parameters. This implementation is based on:

> Niu, J., Mei, S.-J., & Sun, T. (2025). Efficient city-scale wind mapping from building morphology: A CFD-based parameterization scheme. Sustainable Cities and Society, 131, 106688.

### Key Features
- **Advanced Wind Modeling**: Uses both plan area density (λp) and frontal area density (λf) for improved accuracy
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates with existing SUEWS diagnostic framework via DiagMethod=3
- **Computational Efficiency**: Provides CFD-quality results without computational overhead
- **Morphological Interface**: Automatic conversion from SUEWS FAI/PAI parameters

### Implementation Files
- **`src/suews/src/suews_phys_windparam.f95`**: Core CFD wind parameterization module
- **`src/suews/src/suews_phys_morphconv.f95`**: Morphological parameter conversion utilities  
- **`src/suews/src/suews_phys_rslprof.f95`**: Integration with RSL diagnostics (CFD_WindDiagnostics_DTS)
- **`src/suews/src/suews_ctrl_driver.f95`**: Driver integration for DiagMethod=3
- **`src/suews/src/suews_test_windparam.f95`**: Validation test suite

### Usage
Set `DiagMethod = 3` in SUEWS configuration to enable CFD-based wind diagnostics. The method will:
1. Convert existing FAI/PAI values to λf/λp parameters
2. Apply CFD parameterization equations for canopy and pedestrian wind speeds
3. Generate wind profiles compatible with standard SUEWS output

### Equations Implemented
**Canopy Layer**: `U*c = 0.017L^(-2.2) + 0.09` (R² = 0.996)
**Pedestrian Level**: `U*p = exp(-43L^4) × (0.74 - 2.52L) / L + 0.297` (R² = 0.988)

Where L combines morphological parameters:
- Canopy: `L = -0.36λp + 0.98λf + 0.1`
- Pedestrian: `L = -0.26λp + 0.97λf + 0.1`

### Testing
Run validation tests with: `make test-windparam`

### Scientific Impact
- Addresses systematic errors in existing multilayer canopy models (MLUCM)
- Particularly valuable for high-density Asian cities where traditional methods show limitations
- Bridges detailed CFD understanding with practical urban modeling needs

## Worktree Context Management

### Branch-Specific Plans
When working in a git worktree or on a specific feature branch, check for branch-specific context and plans:

1. **First, identify current branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **Then check for the corresponding plan:**
   
   Plans can be either **simple** (single file) or **complex** (directory):
   
   **Simple features:**
   ```bash
   # Check for single file
   cat ../../.claude/plans/doing/feature-{branch-name}.md
   ```
   
   **Complex features:**
   ```bash
   # Check for directory with multiple files
   cat ../../.claude/plans/doing/feature-{branch-name}/README.md
   cat ../../.claude/plans/doing/feature-{branch-name}/requirements.md
   cat ../../.claude/plans/doing/feature-{branch-name}/design.md
   cat ../../.claude/plans/doing/feature-{branch-name}/tasks.md
   ```

3. **If no plan exists**, proceed with standard development practices.

### IMPORTANT: Updating Plans During Work

For detailed instructions on working with plans in worktrees, see:
- `.claude/howto/worktree-workflow.md` - Complete workflow guide
- `.claude/howto/parallel-development.md` - Multi-agent considerations

### Development and Testing Workflow

See `.claude/reference/build-isolation.md` for complete testing and build workflow.

### Plan Lifecycle Management

Plans support two structures based on feature complexity:

**Simple Features** (single file):
- Use for: bug fixes, small enhancements, single-developer work
- Created by: `/worktree new` command
- Structure: Single `.md` file with inline progress tracking

**Complex Features** (directory):
- Use for: API changes, multi-component features, formal requirements
- Structure: Directory with README.md + optional requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md
- Benefits: Separation of concerns, no duplication, formal specifications

For complete guide, see:
- `.claude/plans/README.md` - Unified plan structure and lifecycle
- `.claude/templates/feature-plan.md` - Simple plan template


## Git and GitHub Tips

- **IMPORTANT**: Always use `origin` as the only git remote for this repository
- When using gh cli, first check remotes with `git remote -v`
- If multiple remotes exist, remove all except `origin`:
  ```bash
  git remote remove upstream
  git remote remove Urban-Meteorology-Reading
  # Keep only: origin -> git@github.com:UMEP-dev/SUEWS.git
  ```

## Issue Triage and Labeling

- For detailed issue triage process, see `dev-ref/issue-triage.md`
- Use four-tier labeling system: Type (1-*), Area (2-*), Priority (3-*), Status (4-*)
- Numbers enable quick filtering in GitHub web interface (e.g., type "2-" to see all areas)
- Status labels include:
  - `4-needs-science` - Requires scientific input/decision (flags for domain experts)
  - `4-needs-deps` - Waiting on other issues/PRs to complete first
- Unlabeled issues implicitly need triage - no separate triage label needed

## Style and Language Guidelines

- Any human writing in this project should use British English - docs/code annotations etc

## Testing Resources

### Benchmark Test Files
- For testing: configuration file `p_config = Path("test/benchmark1/benchmark1.yml")` 
- For testing: forcing data file `p_forcing = Path("test/benchmark1/forcing/Kc1_2011_data_5.txt")`

### Critical Testing Requirements for SUEWS

**IMPORTANT**: Before committing any changes, ALWAYS run the full test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests (as per Makefile)
make test
# This executes: python -m pytest test -v --tb=short
```

The test suite includes several critical tests:
- **Benchmark Test** (`test_benchmark1_same`): Validates SUEWS model outputs against known good results
- **Precheck Tests**: Validate input data preprocessing and validation logic
- **Data Model Tests**: Ensure data structures work correctly
- **Conditional Validation Tests**: Check physics option compatibility

### Benchmark Test Details

The benchmark test (`test_supy.py::TestSuPy::test_benchmark1_same`) is particularly critical as it:
- Loads configuration from `test/benchmark1/benchmark1.yml`
- Runs a full year SUEWS simulation with real forcing data
- Compares outputs against pre-computed results (`benchmark1.pkl`)
- Validates key physics variables within 0.8% tolerance:
  - QN (Net all-wave radiation)
  - QF (Anthropogenic heat flux)
  - QS (Storage heat flux)
  - QE (Latent heat flux)
  - QH (Sensible heat flux)
  - T2 (2m air temperature)
  - RH2 (2m relative humidity)
  - U10 (10m wind speed)

If the benchmark test fails after your changes:
1. Check if changes affect model physics calculations
2. Verify data structures and field mappings remain compatible
3. Review any modifications to the Fortran-Python interface
4. Ensure all required model physics options are properly initialised
5. Check that field name changes are consistently applied everywhere

Common locations to debug benchmark failures:
- `src/supy/_run.py` - Model execution logic
- `src/supy/data_model/` - Data structures and validation
- `src/supy/_load.py` - Data loading and preprocessing
- `test/benchmark1/` - Benchmark configuration and expected results

## Documentation Guidelines

- Remember the yaml rst files are generated - so modify the `generate_datamodel_rst.py` script rather than the rst files if edits are needed

## SUEWS Configuration Builder Web Interface

The project includes an interactive web-based configuration builder located at `docs/source/_static/`:

### Key Files:
- **index.html** - Main HTML interface with Bootstrap styling
- **config-builder.js** - JavaScript logic for form generation and validation
- **config-builder.css** - Custom styling for the interface
- **suews-config-schema.json** - JSON Schema generated from the Pydantic data model

### Features:
- Interactive form generation from JSON Schema
- Real-time YAML preview of configuration
- Import/Export functionality (YAML format)
- Client-side validation using AJV
- Responsive design with collapsible sections
- Array handling with add/remove/copy functionality
- Support for complex nested structures

### Maintenance:
- **Schema Updates**: Run `python docs/gen_schema.py` to regenerate the schema when data model changes
- **Testing**: Open `docs/source/_static/index.html` directly in a browser to test
- **Array Initialization**: Arrays start empty - users add items via "Add Item" buttons
- **Object Display**: Empty objects in arrays are not pre-populated to avoid "[object Object]" display issues

## Development Tasks and Reminders

- **Remember to include new files in meson.build appropriately**
- **IMPORTANT**: When creating new source files that are part of the build, always update the corresponding meson.build file:
  - Python files (.py) in src/supy/
  - Fortran files (.f90, .f95) in src/suews/src/
  - Any other source files that need to be compiled or installed

## Configuration Handling and Method Design Pattern

### Principle: Separation of Concerns Between Configuration and Implementation

When working with configuration objects and implementation methods in SUEWS/SuPy, follow this strict separation:

1. **High-Level Classes (e.g., SUEWSSimulation)**: 
   - **DO**: Parse and interpret configuration objects
   - **DO**: Extract specific values from nested config structures
   - **DO**: Handle RefValue wrappers and type conversions
   - **DO**: Transform config data into concrete parameters
   - **DON'T**: Pass configuration objects to lower-level methods

2. **Low-Level Methods (e.g., save_supy, run_supy)**:
   - **DO**: Accept explicit, typed parameters (int, str, float, etc.)
   - **DO**: Focus on the core functionality without config knowledge
   - **DON'T**: Accept configuration objects as parameters
   - **DON'T**: Import or depend on configuration classes

### Example Pattern:

**WRONG Approach:**
```python
# High-level class passing config directly
def save(self, output_path, format=None):
    if format == "txt":
        # DON'T do this - passing config object to low-level method
        save_supy(df_output, df_state, output_config=self._config.output)
```

**CORRECT Approach:**
```python
# High-level class extracting and transforming config
def save(self, output_path, format=None):
    if format == "txt":
        # Extract specific parameters from config
        freq_s = 3600  # default
        if self._config and hasattr(self._config.output, 'freq'):
            freq_s = self._config.output.freq.value  # Handle RefValue
        
        # Pass concrete parameters to low-level method
        save_supy(df_output, df_state, freq_s=int(freq_s), site=site_name)
```

### Rationale:

1. **Reusability**: Low-level methods remain usable without config objects
2. **Testing**: Easier to test methods with explicit parameters
3. **Clarity**: Clear contracts - methods declare exactly what they need
4. **Flexibility**: Config structure can change without affecting core methods
5. **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing code using explicit parameters continues to work

### Implementation Checklist:

When implementing a feature that uses configuration:

- [ ] Identify what concrete parameters the low-level method needs
- [ ] Extract these values in the high-level class
- [ ] Handle RefValue wrappers (check for `.value` attribute)
- [ ] Convert types as needed (e.g., ensure integers for numeric parameters)
- [ ] Pass only primitive types or simple objects to low-level methods
- [ ] Keep configuration parsing logic in one place (the high-level class)

This pattern ensures clean architecture and maintains the intended separation between configuration management and core functionality.

## Current Investigations and Findings

### QE/QH Discrepancy Investigation (Branch: matthewp/testing_sample_data) - ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Issue**: Tests pass individually but fail when run in full test suite, specifically `test_sample_output_validation` with QE/QH mismatches.

**Root Cause Identified**: Uninitialized Fortran variables in derived types cause state pollution between test runs, compounded by exact floating-point equality checks.

#### Key Findings:
1. **Critical Code Location**: `src/suews/src/suews_phys_atmmoiststab.f95` lines 243 and 288
   ```fortran
   IF (H == 0.) THEN
   ```
   These exact equality checks behave differently with compiler optimizations.

2. **Compiler Testing Results**:
   - Fast build (`-O1`): Fails sample output test in full suite without pytest-order
   - Slow build (`-O0 -fcheck=all`): Also fails sample output test in full suite without pytest-order
   - **Both configurations affected by state leakage, but severity varies**

3. **Causal Chain**:
   - Atmospheric stability calculations use exact floating-point equality
   - Different compiler optimizations affect floating-point behaviour
   - This cascades through resistance calculations into QE/QH computations
   - Results in different model outputs depending on test execution order

#### Technical Details:
- **Affected Module**: `suews_phys_atmmoiststab.f95` - Atmospheric stability calculations
- **Impact**: QE (Latent Heat Flux) and QH (Sensible Heat Flux) calculations
- **Masking Factor**: pytest-order was controlling test execution order
- **Build Configuration**: Both fast and slow builds affected when pytest-order removed

#### Files Investigated:
- `src/suews/src/suews_phys_atmmoiststab.f95` - Contains problematic exact equality checks
- `src/suews/src/suews_phys_resist.f95` - Aerodynamic resistance calculations
- `src/suews/src/suews_phys_evap.f95` - Evaporation calculations
- `src/supy_driver/meson.build` - Compiler flag configuration
- `meson_options.txt` - Fast build option definition
- `test/test_sample_output.py` - Failing test case

#### Recommendations:
1. **Replace exact equality checks** with epsilon-based comparisons
2. **Ensure proper Fortran variable initialization** to prevent state leakage
3. **Add comprehensive tests** for floating-point stability
4. **Implement state isolation** between test runs

#### Status: Investigation Complete - ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED**
- [x] Identified root cause of QE/QH discrepancies
- [x] Tested both compiler configurations
- [x] Confirmed state leakage affects both build types
- [x] Documented exact code locations needing fixes
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite for floating-point stability
- [x] Implemented fixes for exact equality checks
- [x] Added general floating-point epsilon constant (`eps_fp = 1.0E-12`)
- [x] Fixed both problematic `IF (H == 0.)` checks in `suews_phys_atmmoiststab.f95`
- [x] **COMPLETE RESOLUTION**: Initialized all atmospheric state variables in `atm_state` type
- [x] **FULL TEST SUITE PASSES**: All tests now pass individually and in full suite
- [x] **EXECUTION ORDER INDEPENDENCE**: Results identical regardless of test execution order

#### Fix Details:
**Location**: `/src/suews/src/suews_ctrl_const.f95` - Added to `PhysConstants` module:
```fortran
REAL(KIND(1D0)), PARAMETER :: eps_fp = 1.0E-12 !Epsilon for floating-point near-zero comparisons
```

**Fixes Applied**: `/src/suews/src/suews_phys_atmmoiststab.f95` - Changed exact equality checks:
```fortran
! Before: IF (H == 0.) THEN
! After:  IF (ABS(H) <= eps_fp) THEN
```

**Final Solution**: `/src/suews/src/suews_ctrl_type.f95` - Initialized all atmospheric state variables:
```fortran
! Critical atmospheric state variables now initialized:
REAL(KIND(1D0)) :: L_mod = 0.0D0 !Obukhov length [m]
REAL(KIND(1D0)) :: zL = 0.0D0 ! Stability scale [-]
REAL(KIND(1D0)) :: RA_h = 0.0D0 ! aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]
REAL(KIND(1D0)) :: RS = 0.0D0 ! surface resistance [s m-1]
REAL(KIND(1D0)) :: UStar = 0.0D0 !friction velocity [m s-1]
REAL(KIND(1D0)) :: TStar = 0.0D0 !T*, temperature scale [-]
REAL(KIND(1D0)) :: RB = 0.0D0 !boundary layer resistance shuttleworth
REAL(KIND(1D0)) :: rss_surf = 0.0D0 ! surface resistance [s m-1]
! ... and ALL other atmospheric variables
```

#### Results:
- ✅ **COMPLETE SUCCESS**: Fixed all state leakage issues
- ✅ **PERFECT RESOLUTION**: QE/QH difference reduced to 0.000000 (complete elimination)
- ✅ Individual `test_sample_output_validation` passes
- ✅ **FULL TEST SUITE PASSES**: All tests pass in any execution order
- ✅ Floating-point stability tests all pass
- ✅ **EXECUTION ORDER INDEPENDENCE**: Results identical regardless of test sequence
- ✅ **ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED**: No remaining state pollution detected

#### Comparison: Before vs After Complete Fix
**Before Fix (Original Code)**:
- QE failures: 288 points, max relative diff: **37.87%**
- QH failures: Similar magnitude
- Failed at indices around 286-335 (first day of data)
- Tests fail in full suite, pass individually

**After Complete Fix (Epsilon + Variable Initialization)**:
- QE failures: **0 points**, max relative diff: **0.000000%**
- QH failures: **0 points**, max relative diff: **0.000000%**
- **NO FAILURES**: All tests pass in any execution order
- **IDENTICAL RESULTS**: First run = Second run = Nth run

**Impact**: Complete elimination of QE/QH discrepancies and state pollution

#### ✅ **COMPLETE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
1. **✅ FIXED**: Exact equality checks replaced with epsilon-based comparisons
2. **✅ RESOLVED**: All atmospheric state variables initialized in `atm_state` type
3. **✅ SYSTEMATIC SOLUTION**: GitHub Issue #504 created for comprehensive variable initialization
4. **✅ PREVENTION**: Coding standards established for floating-point comparisons
5. **✅ VALIDATION**: All tests pass across both compiler configurations

#### **Systematic Fix in Progress** (GitHub Issue #504):
- **492 REAL variables** identified without initialization across 34 types
- **59 INTEGER variables** identified without initialization  
- **Priority types**: HEAT_STATE, HYDRO_STATE, STEBBS_STATE, ROUGHNESS_STATE
- **Implementation plan**: 4-phase approach over 4 weeks

- [x] Tests access QE/QH via result.SUEWS['QE'] and result.SUEWS['QH']
- [x] Tests validated and working correctly
- [x] Tests specifically target the identified issues in the investigation

#### **Lessons Learned & Best Practices**:

1. **Variable Initialization is Critical**: 
   - Always initialize ALL Fortran variables in derived types
   - Use `= 0.0D0` for REAL variables, `= 0` for INTEGER variables
   - Don't rely on compiler-dependent default initialization

2. **Avoid Exact Floating-Point Equality**: 
   - Replace `IF (variable == 0.)` with `IF (ABS(variable) <= eps_fp)`
   - Use epsilon-based comparisons for all floating-point operations
   - Define a consistent epsilon constant (`eps_fp = 1.0E-12`)

3. **Test Execution Order Independence**:
   - Always test both individual tests AND full test suite
   - Create specific tests for execution order independence
   - Use floating-point stability tests to catch state pollution

4. **Systematic Debugging Approach**:
   - Start with simple reproduction cases
   - Use manual test scripts to isolate issues
   - Investigate compiler-dependent behavior
   - Document findings thoroughly for future reference

5. **State Pollution Prevention**:
   - Never assume variables are initialized to zero
   - Always provide explicit default values in type definitions
   - Test for state leakage between function calls
   - Use comprehensive test suites to catch edge cases

## Documentation & Code Maintenance Principles

### Documentation Updates for Code Changes

When making code changes to SUEWS/SuPy:
- **Always update relevant documentation** in `docs/` directory when functionality changes
- Update Sphinx documentation for user-facing changes
- **Documentation generation scripts** (run ONLY when specific changes occur):
  - Run `python docs/generate_datamodel_rst.py` - ONLY when Pydantic data model structure changes (adding/removing fields, changing types)
  - Run `python docs/gen_schema.py` - ONLY when configuration schema needs regeneration for the web UI
  - These scripts are NOT run for routine CHANGELOG updates or validator migrations
- Ensure examples and tutorials reflect current API
- Update parameter tables and input file documentation as needed
- **Update CHANGELOG.md promptly** for remarkable changes using categories:
  - [feature]: New features
  - [bugfix]: Bug fixes (also create GitHub issue)
  - [change]: User-facing changes
  - [maintenance]: Codebase maintenance (including Claude Code development aspects AND updates to CLAUDE.md)
  - [doc]: Documentation updates (user-facing documentation in docs/, NOT CLAUDE.md)
- **IMPORTANT**: Updates to CLAUDE.md should be categorised as [maintenance], not [doc]

### Documentation Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth (DRY)**
   - Every piece of information should exist in exactly ONE place
   - Example: Package lists in one file, referenced everywhere else

2. **Reference Over Duplication**
   - Use `See: path/to/doc.md` instead of copying content
   - Example: `For complete setup, see .claude/howto/setup-worktree.md`

3. **Clear Documentation Hierarchy**
   ```
   .claude/
   ├── howto/          # Step-by-step guides (practical)
   ├── reference/      # Technical details & specifications
   ├── templates/      # Reusable templates
   └── plans/          # Feature-specific work tracking
   ```

4. **Focused Documents**
   - Each file should have ONE clear purpose
   - Example: `build-isolation.md` only explains why isolation is needed

5. **Brief Overview Pattern**
   - Main files (like CLAUDE.md) should be concise overviews
   - Details go in sub-documents with clear references

6. **Centralize Common Lists**
   - Package lists, commands, requirements → single file
   - Example: `core-requirements.txt` instead of inline lists everywhere

### Code Principles

7. **Single Responsibility**
   - Each function/class does ONE thing well
   - Example: `save_supy()` only saves, doesn't validate or transform

8. **Explicit Over Implicit**
   ```python
   # Good: Clear what parameters are needed
   save_supy(df_output, df_state, freq_s=3600, site="London")
   
   # Bad: Hidden configuration dependencies
   save_supy(df_output, df_state, config_obj)
   ```

9. **Extract Common Patterns**
   - Common operations in utility functions
   - Example: Validation logic in `validation_utils.py`

10. **Configuration Over Code Duplication**
    ```python
    # Define once, use everywhere
    PACKAGE_MAPPING = {
        'matplotlib-base': 'matplotlib',  # conda → pip name
        'pytables': 'tables'
    }
    ```

11. **Composition Over Complex Inheritance**
    ```python
    # Flexible and testable
    class Model:
        def __init__(self, validator, processor, saver):
            self.validator = validator
            self.processor = processor
            self.saver = saver
    ```

12. **Version/Platform Isolation**
    ```python
    # compat.py - isolate compatibility code
    if sys.version_info >= (3, 13):
        from new_module import feature
    else:
        from old_module import feature
    ```

### Maintenance Best Practices

- **Important information first**: Style guidelines, critical warnings at the top
- **Progressive disclosure**: Quick start → Details → Troubleshooting
- **Cross-reference related content**: "See also:" sections for navigation
- **Use templates for repetitive patterns**: Avoid explaining the same structure multiple times
- **Document package name differences ONCE**: Create mappings, reference everywhere
