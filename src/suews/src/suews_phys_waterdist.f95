      !   - Allow irrigation on all surfaces (previously only on vegetated surfaces)
      ! LJ 27 Jan 2016
      !   - Removed tabs and cleaned the code
      ! HCW 08 Dec 2015
      !   -Added if-loop check for no Paved surfaces
      ! LJ 6 May 2015
      !   - Calculations of the piperunoff exceedings moved to separate subroutine updateFlood.
      !   - Now also called from snow subroutine
      !   - Evaporation is modified using EvapPart
      !   - when no water on impervious surfaces, evap occurs above pervious surfaces instead
      ! Rewritten by HCW 12 Feb 2015
      !   - Old variable 'p' for water input to the surface renamed to 'p_mm'
      !   - All water now added to p_mm first, before threshold checks or other calculations
      !   - Water from other grids now added to p_mm (instead of state_id for impervious surfaces)
      !   - Removed division of runoff by nsh, as whole model now runs at the same timestep
      !   - Adjusted transfer of ev between surfaces to conserve mass (not depth)
      !   - Volumes used for water transport between grids to account for SurfaceArea changing between grids
      !   - Added threshold check for state_id(WaterSurf) - was going negative
      ! Last modified HCW 09 Feb 2015
      !   - Removed StorCap input because it is provided by module allocateArray
      !   - Tidied and commented code
      ! Modified by LJ in November 2012:
      !   - P>10 was not taken into account for impervious surfaces - Was fixed.
      !   - Above impervious surfaces possibility of the state_id to exceed max capacity was limited
      !     although this should be possible - was fixed
      ! Modified by LJ 10/2010
      ! Rewritten mostly by LJ in 2010
      ! To do:
      !   - Finish area normalisation for RG2G & finish coding GridConnections
      !   - What is the 10 mm hr-1 threshold for?
      !  - Decide upon and correct storage capacities here & in evap subroutine
      !  - FlowChange units should be mm hr-1 - need to update everywhere
      !   - Add SurfaceFlood(is)?
      !   - What happens if sfr_surf(is) = 0 or 1?
      !   - Consider how irrigated trees actually works...
