# Feature: cibuildwheel SSH Debug Workflow

## Context
Create a dispatch workflow that allows manual triggering with specific platform and Python version combinations, includes SSH access for debugging, and has Claude Code CLI installed for AI-assisted debugging of cibuildwheel build errors.

## GitHub Issues
- None (internal debugging tool)

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Create worktree for feature
- [x] Create dispatch workflow with platform/python selection
- [x] Add comprehensive logging and error capture
- [ ] Test workflow on different platforms
- [x] Document usage instructions

## Key Features
1. **Manual Dispatch**: Workflow can be triggered manually with specific parameters
2. **Platform Selection**: Choose from ubuntu-latest, macos-13, macos-latest, windows-2025
3. **Python Version**: Select from cp39, cp310, cp311, cp312, cp313
4. **Architecture**: Choose x86_64, arm64, AMD64, or x86
5. **Debug Modes**:
   - `before-build`: SSH session before cibuildwheel starts
   - `after-failure`: SSH session only if build fails
   - `always`: SSH sessions both before and after
   - `disabled`: No SSH sessions
6. **Claude Code Integration**: CLI installed for AI-assisted debugging

## Implementation Notes
- Uses same environment variables as main build workflow
- Includes verbose logging (CIBW_BUILD_VERBOSITY: 3)
- Uploads logs and artifacts for post-mortem analysis
- SSH sessions limited to workflow actor for security
- 60-minute timeout for debug sessions

## Usage Instructions
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Debug cibuildwheel with SSH" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select platform, Python version, architecture, and debug mode
5. When SSH session starts, connect using provided command
6. Use Claude Code CLI for debugging: `claude -p "help me debug this cibuildwheel error"`
