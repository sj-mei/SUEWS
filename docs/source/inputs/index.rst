Input Files
===========

This section provides detailed documentation for SUEWS input files.

SUEWS supports two formats for providing input parameters:

1.  **YAML format**: The current, recommended format using a single `config_suews.yml` file. It is designed to be more user-friendly and maintainable.
2.  **Table-based format**: The legacy format, which will be deprecated in future versions but is still supported for backward compatibility.
