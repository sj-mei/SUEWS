SUEWS in UMEP
--------------


SUEWS can be run as a standalone model but also can be used within `UMEP <http://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/>`_.
There are numerous tools included within UMEP to help a user get started.
The `SUEWS (Simple)`_ within UMEP is a fast way to start using SUEWS.

The version of SUEWS within UMEP is the complete model.
Thus all options that are listed in this manual are available to the user.
In the UMEP `SUEWS (Simple)`_ runs all options are set to values to allow initial exploration of the model behaviour.

.. _Differences_between_SUEWS_LUMPS_and_FRAISE:


Differences between SUEWS, LUMPS and FRAISE
--------------------------------------------------------


The largest difference between LUMPS and SUEWS is that the latter
simulates the urban water balance in detail while LUMPS takes a simpler
approach for the sensible and latent heat fluxes and the water balance
(“water bucket”). The calculation of evaporation/latent heat in SUEWS is
more biophysically based. Due to its simplicity, LUMPS requires less
parameters in order to run. SUEWS gives turbulent heat fluxes calculated
with both models as an output.

Similarities and differences between LUMPS and SUEWS.

FRAISE Flux Ratio – Active Index Surface Exchange
-------------------------------------------------

FRAISE provides an estimate of mean midday (±3 h around solar noon) energy partitioning from information on the surface characteristics and estimates of the mean midday incoming radiative energy and anthropogenic heat release.
Please refer to :cite:t:`LG12` for further details.
