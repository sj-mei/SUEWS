What is SUEWS?
---------------

Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (**SUEWS**) :cite:`J11,W16` is a neighbourhood/local-scale urban land surface model delivered through **SuPy**, a comprehensive Python interface that integrates seamlessly with the scientific Python ecosystem.

SUEWS simulates the urban radiation, energy and water balances using only commonly measured meteorological variables and information about the surface cover. The model utilises an evaporation-interception approach :cite:`GO91`, similar to that used in forests, to model evaporation from urban surfaces.

**SuPy** (SUEWS in Python) provides the modern interface for SUEWS with powerful data analysis capabilities, interactive configuration tools, and seamless integration with pandas, matplotlib, and the broader scientific Python stack.

	Overview of SUEWS

The model uses seven surface types: paved, buildings, evergreen trees/shrubs, deciduous trees/shrubs, grass, bare soil and water.
The surface state for each surface type at each time step is calculated from the running water balance of the canopy where the evaporation is calculated from the Penman-Monteith equation.
The soil moisture below each surface type (excluding water) is taken into account.
Horizontal movement of water above and below ground level is allowed.

How to get SUEWS?
------------------------------

**Modern Python Interface (Recommended):**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install SuPy (includes SUEWS)
   pip install supy

**Alternative Installation:**

For legacy table-based workflows, please follow the guidance in :ref:`installation` to get SUEWS.


How to use SUEWS?
------------------------------

**Quick Start (Recommended):**

Get started immediately with the :ref:`Getting Started with SUEWS <Workflow>` guide, which provides an interactive tutorial using sample data and modern Python tools.

**For new users:**

1. **Install SuPy**: ``pip install supy``
2. **Follow tutorials**: Start with :ref:`SUEWS Tutorials <tutorials_suews>` for hands-on learning
3. **Configure your site**: Use the :ref:`Configuration Guide <Workflow>` and YAML tools
4. **Explore advanced features**: Multi-site studies, climate impacts, model coupling

**For existing users:**

- **Migration guide**: :ref:`Transition from table-based inputs <inputs/transition_guide>` to modern YAML configuration
- **Version changes**: See :ref:`new_latest` for updates in this version
- **Legacy support**: The `SUEWS table converter <input_converter>` helps convert existing input files

**Scientific Background:**

Before performing SUEWS simulations, users should understand the :ref:`physical principles <parameterisations-and-sub-models>` and review `input requirements <input_files>` for their specific application.
