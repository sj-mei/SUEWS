0,"Uses values provided in the meteorological forcing file (SSss_YYYY_data_tt.txt).
If you do not want to include QF to the calculation of surface energy balance, you should set values in the meteorological forcing file to zero to prevent calculation of QF.
UMEP provides two methods to calculate QF
LQF which is simpler
GQF which is more complete but requires more data inputs"
1,"|NotRecmd|
Calculated according to :cite:t:`L11` using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt`.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file."
2,"|Recmd|
Calculated according to :cite:t:`J11` using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt` and diurnal patterns specified in `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file."
3,"Updated :cite:t:`L11` method using daily (not instantaneous) air temperature (HDD(id-1,3)) using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt`.
4,":cite:t:`J19` method, in addition to anthropogenic heat due to building energy use calculated by :cite:t:`J11`, that due to metabolism and traffic is also calculated using coefficients specified in `SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt` and diurnal patterns specified in `SUEWS_Profiles.txt`.
Modelled values will be used even if QF is provided in the meteorological forcing file."
