  :Type:
    Float

  :Requirement:
    `MD`
  :Type:
    Float
  :Description:
    Longwave single scattering albedo of vegetation

  :Configuration:
    - 0.06 (|Recmd|)
    - Should be estimated using a vegetation type in https://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov/library (see `Vegetation single scattering albedo (SSA)` for details).
      - Reflectance is ~0.04 for Acer Pensylvanicum,
      - ~0.02 for Quercus Robur and
      - ~0.04 for Betula Lenta.
